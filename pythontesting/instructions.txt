I've been generating the plots in Atom using a cool package called Hydrogen. 
I select all the code using Command->A and then generate the plot with Command-R. 
Just make sure your data files are stored locally to the plotsorts.py and named the same as what I named them. 
I commented out some line of best fit and upper-bound graphing which is cool but unnecessary right now.
